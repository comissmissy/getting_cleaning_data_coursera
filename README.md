# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
The course project for Getting and Cleaning Data is to read in the [Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set](http://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip), clean the data set, and output a tidy data set.

This repo contains the following files:
1. run_analysis.R - R script to work with and clean the data
2. CodeBook.md - document that describes the variables, data, and transformations performed
3. tidy_data.txt - tidy output data set as described below

Additional information may be found in the CodeBook.md.

Note: The data must be downloaded and the working directory set to the new folder prior to running the script.
